Description:
The Farm Management System is a beginner-friendly Java-based application designed to help users manage their farms and livestock efficiently. This project provides junior developers with hands-on experience in creating a practical application using object-oriented programming (OOP), data persistence, and basic user interfaces. It introduces concepts like entity management, relationship handling, and simple reporting, making it an excellent learning project.

Features:

Farm Registration and Setup:
Allow users to create a farm profile with details like farm name, location, and type (e.g., dairy, poultry, crops).
Enable the addition of multiple farms for multi-farm owners.

Animal Management:
Add, update, or remove animals with attributes such as species (e.g., cow, chicken), age, health status, and breed.
Keep track of vaccination records, feeding schedules, and productivity (e.g., milk yield, egg count).

Crop Management:
Manage crop types, planting dates, and expected harvest dates.
Track crop health and yields.

Task Scheduling:
Assign daily tasks like feeding, cleaning, and milking to workers or yourself.
Maintain a task log and mark tasks as complete.
Inventory Management:
Track inventory for animal feed, fertilizers, and other farm supplies.
Generate alerts for low stock levels.

Reports and Visualization:
Summarize farm performance with reports such as animal health status, productivity trends, and task completion rates.
Use basic charts or tables for data representation (e.g., animal count by species, milk production trends).

Data Persistence:
Save farm data, including animal details, task logs, and inventory, in files or a lightweight database like SQLite.
Load data seamlessly when the application is reopened.

Technical Skills Covered:
Object-Oriented Programming: Learn how to design classes for animals, tasks, inventory, and farms, focusing on encapsulation, relationships, and inheritance.
File I/O: Practice saving and retrieving data to/from text files or a database.
Collections Framework: Use lists, maps, or sets to manage farm data effectively.
Basic Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs like duplicate entries or incorrect data formats.
